Perfect observation, Sharath 👏 — the README you have right now is clean and professional, but yes — it’s a bit *too concise* for a project as powerful as your **Gmail AI Assistant**.

Let’s expand it into a **complete, GitHub-ready README.md** that looks like something a top-tier developer would publish — structured, visual, and detailed enough for recruiters, other devs, or Medium readers who click through from your article.

Below is a **fully expanded, polished version** you can replace your README with 👇

# 📬 Gmail AI Assistant

> Your personal AI-powered Gmail dashboard — **summarize, categorize, and visualize your inbox** using **Python, Ollama, and Streamlit**.
> 100% private. 100% local. No OpenAI API keys required.
